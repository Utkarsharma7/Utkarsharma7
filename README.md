- Hi there! I'm currently a first year student at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science.
I'm passionate about coding, exploring new technologies, and building projects that solve real-world problems.
My GitHub is where I document my learning journey, share projects, and collaborate on exciting ideas.
I'm just getting started with app development and software development, and I'm excited to learn more about creating simple, user-friendly apps and building software.
I'm eager to grow my skills and explore new projects as I learn.
